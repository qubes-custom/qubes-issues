# qubes-issues
[] Nested Virtualization
- It seems Nested Virt is not maintained by Xen Team ([See](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Nested_Virtualization_in_Xen)). So the solution would be KVM hypervisor support (WIP)

[] HVM GPU Acceleration ([See](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QEMU/Guest_graphics_acceleration))
- GPU Passthrough [Single/Multi GPU]
- GPU Virtualization
- Paravirtualized

[] Performance Issues
- Compiling is half-speed of native ([See](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7404))
